Menage-a-trois or The big-game theory or ConvinceMe

An escrow based gambling game by Studio Bodoni 

rules of the game:

3 players chip in a escrow i.e. 10 Eur 

2 players  ( A and B) are randomly selected to play split or steal game, and Receive a google meet link to talk to each other and gain trust for 3 mins (+ historic of last X transactions ?)

(Player C also join the call, is muted and can see the past 3 transactions of the 2 players ?, and can speak maybe for the last 5 seconds)

Both Steal 
- they both loose the money, and the 3rd player wins 20 Eur (10 Eur to dealer)

Both Split 
- A gets 15, B gets 15 , C gets nothing , Dealer gets nothing 

A split,  B- steal 
- A gets 0 , B gets 25 , C gets 0 (dealer gets 5 Eur)

The player that decide to split doesn’t know if the other player will also split, or will steal.
